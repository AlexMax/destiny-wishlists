My curated perk suggestion wishlists for Destiny 2.

This repository contains wishlists generated with my [destiny-wishlist-generator][1] script.

If you have suggestions for perks, you can either file an issue with your suggestions, or if you want to take the initiaitve you can create your own perk data file in the `data` directory.  If you do this, you don't necessarily have to generate the wishlist files yourself, as this is something I can do for you.
